Freelancer Theme is a one page freelancer portfolio based on the [original Bootstrap theme](//github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-freelancer) by [David Miller](//github.com/davidtmiller) and on [Jerome Lachaud](//github.com/jeromelachaud)'s [Jekyll theme](//github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme). This Hugo theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full page portfolio item modals and a contact form.
